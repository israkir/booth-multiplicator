Description
===========
This project aims to make an implementation of Booth's Multiplication Algorithm for MIPS 
architecture.

Booth's Multiplication Algorithm is an approach to reduce the number of arithmetic operations 
necessary to perform a multiplication. It assumes that a shift takes less time than an add or 
subtract instruction and uses this fact in reducing the number of arithmetic instructions.

Simply, it works by identifying the 1s and 0s before performing shifts.
